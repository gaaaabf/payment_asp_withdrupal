# Commerce Wishlist API

Sandbox to provide a RESTful interface to interact with wishlists in Drupal
Commerce via a lightweight public API.

The module's structure and features are very similar to commerce_cart_api,
despite of working with wishlists instead of carts. See commerce_cart_api
README.md for example code in the meantime.
